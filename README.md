## Features

- üìÑ **Advanced PDF Processing**: Convert PDFs to markdown with high accuracy using [Marker](https://github.com/datalab-to/marker)
- ü§ñ **AI Integration**: Multiple AI provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
- üíæ **Document Management**: SQLite-based document storage and organization
- üé® **Modern UI**: Beautiful interface built with React and Tailwind CSS

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- Rust (latest stable)
- Python 3.8+ (for Marker PDF processing)

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Set up Marker for enhanced PDF processing:
```bash
./scripts/setup_marker.sh
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
pnpm tauri dev
```

### PDF Processing

Stellar supports multiple PDF processing modes to suit different needs:

1. **Basic Mode**: Fast text extraction using `pdf-extract`
2. **Enhanced Mode**: Improved text processing with better structure detection
3. **MarkItDown Mode**: Microsoft's lightweight tool for balanced speed and quality
4. **Marker Mode**: High-quality conversion using Marker with deep learning models

#### Setup Processing Tools

**For MarkItDown (Recommended for most users):**
```bash
./scripts/setup_markitdown.sh
```

**For Marker (Best quality, requires more setup):**
```bash
./scripts/setup_marker.sh
./scripts/run_marker.sh
```

#### Processing Options

When uploading PDFs in the application, you can choose from:

- **Basic**: Fast text extraction with minimal processing
- **Enhanced**: Improved structure detection, lists, and headings
- **MarkItDown**: Microsoft's tool - good balance of speed and quality
- **Marker**: Highest quality with 95.6% accuracy for complex documents
