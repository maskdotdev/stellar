# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MDX document viewer currently has a critical text selection issue where users cannot properly select text to trigger the expected popup functionality. When users attempt to select text in MDX documents, the selection disappears immediately, preventing the text selection popover from appearing. This breaks a core interaction pattern that users expect when working with documents, making it impossible to perform text-based actions like highlighting, copying, or other contextual operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to select text in MDX documents and maintain that selection, so that I can interact with the selected content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click and drag to select text in an MDX document THEN the text SHALL remain visually selected
2. WHEN I complete a text selection THEN the selection SHALL persist until I click elsewhere or make a new selection
3. WHEN I select text THEN the browser's native selection behavior SHALL work correctly
4. IF I select text and then move my mouse THEN the selection SHALL remain stable and visible

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a popup to appear above my text selection in MDX documents, so that I can access contextual actions for the selected text.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select text in an MDX document THEN a popup SHALL appear above the selection
2. WHEN the popup appears THEN it SHALL be positioned correctly relative to the selected text
3. WHEN I select different text THEN the popup SHALL move to the new selection location
4. IF I click outside the selection or popup THEN both the selection and popup SHALL disappear
5. WHEN the popup is visible THEN it SHALL not interfere with the document's readability

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the text selection and popup functionality to work consistently across different types of content within MDX documents, so that I have a uniform experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select text in paragraphs THEN the selection and popup SHALL work correctly
2. WHEN I select text in headings THEN the selection and popup SHALL work correctly
3. WHEN I select text in lists THEN the selection and popup SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN I select text in code blocks THEN the selection and popup SHALL work correctly
5. WHEN I select text across multiple elements THEN the selection SHALL span correctly and the popup SHALL appear

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests for the text selection functionality, so that I can ensure the feature works reliably and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running automated tests THEN they SHALL verify that text selection persists correctly
2. WHEN running automated tests THEN they SHALL verify that the popup appears at the correct position
3. WHEN running automated tests THEN they SHALL verify that the popup disappears when appropriate
4. WHEN running automated tests THEN they SHALL cover different types of MDX content
5. WHEN running automated tests THEN they SHALL simulate user interaction patterns accurately
