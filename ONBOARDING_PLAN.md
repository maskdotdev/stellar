# 🚀 Stellar - New User Onboarding Plan

> **Goal**: Get new users from "What is this?" to "This is amazing!" in under 5 minutes

## 📋 **Current Problem Analysis**

**What users see now:**
- Complex settings with 5+ tabs
- No clear starting point
- Overwhelming feature set
- Technical jargon (embeddings, providers, etc.)
- No immediate value demonstration

**What users need:**
- Clear understanding of what Stellar does
- Simple setup process
- Immediate value demonstration
- Progressive feature discovery

---

## 🎯 **Core Value Proposition**

**Stellar transforms how you study and research by:**
1. **AI-powered document chat** - Ask questions about your PDFs
2. **Semantic search** - Find information by meaning, not just keywords
3. **Smart note-taking** - Capture insights with AI assistance
4. **Spaced repetition** - Generate and review flashcards automatically
5. **Study session tracking** - Monitor your learning progress

---

## 🚦 **Essential vs Optional Setup**

### **✅ ESSENTIAL (Must have to start)**
1. **AI Chat Provider** - Without this, core features don't work
   - OpenAI (easiest, requires API key)
   - Ollama (free, local, requires installation)
   - Anthropic (alternative, requires API key)

### **🔧 RECOMMENDED (Unlocks full potential)**
2. **Embedding Models** - Enables semantic search
   - Ollama with `all-minilm` model (free, local)
   - OpenAI embeddings (paid, cloud)

### **⚡ OPTIONAL (Advanced features)**
3. **PDF Processing Tools** - Better PDF conversion
   - MarkItDown (recommended balance)
   - Marker (best quality, complex setup)
4. **Advanced Settings** - Themes, keybindings, etc.
