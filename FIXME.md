> **For comprehensive feature development roadmap, see [STUDENT_PRO_ROADMAP.md](./STUDENT_PRO_ROADMAP.md)**

## üêõ **Current Bugs & Issues**

### IMPORTANT
- [x] Adding new selection from pdf viewer to an existing note doesn't work, should add the new selection at the end of the note. (FIXED: Race condition resolved with proper timing and store synchronization)
- [ ] When we have a document reference in a note, we should be able to click on it and "navigate" to the document.
- [x] Change upload document text to "Add PDF"
- [x] Check for any ChromaDB code, should be removed. (FIXED: Updated misleading ChromaDB references to reflect sqlite-vec migration)
- [x] Create onboarding flow for new users (COMPLETED)
  - ‚úÖ 3-step guided dialog implemented
  - ‚úÖ Simple AI provider setup with connection testing
  - ‚úÖ Persistent flag-based completion tracking
  - ‚úÖ Integrated into main app with proper state management
  - ‚úÖ OpenAI auto-configures embeddings with same API key (one key = full functionality)

### Other
- [ ] Conversation history is not being properly saved/loaded between sessions
- [ ] Document mentions in chat don't always resolve correctly
- [ ] Chat scroll position resets when minimizing/maximizing
- [ ] Category navigation breadcrumbs don't update correctly in some cases
- [ ] Document search doesn't include content from uploaded PDFs
- [ ] Category colors not consistently applied across components
- [ ] Focus mode indicator sometimes persists after exiting focus mode

## üéØ **Priority Issues for Student Features**

### **High Priority** (Blocks student workflow)
- [ ] Conversation persistence for study session continuity
- [ ] Document-chat relationship tracking
- [ ] Search functionality across all content types

### **Medium Priority** (Improves student experience)
- [ ] Session detection and management
- [ ] Document navigation from notes
- [ ] Better mobile experience for on-the-go studying

### **Low Priority** (Polish and optimization)

## üìã **Development Notes**
- Consider implementing action tracking system to catch and debug state management issues
- Need to improve error handling and user feedback for failed operations
- Should add comprehensive logging for debugging study workflow issues
